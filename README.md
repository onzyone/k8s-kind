## Deploy with Helm
This has been moved into the tiltfie: [k8s-tilt](https://github.com/onzyone/k8s-tilt)

## Stop
1. Run the following to stop kind and the local registry.
    ```bash
    $ bin/kind-local-setup.sh stop
    Deleting cluster "kind" ...
    kind-registry
    ```

# Troubleshooting 

1. Note: you may update your local hosts file as well, for example by adding 127.0.0.1 registry in your laptop's /etc/hosts, so you can reference it in a consistent way by simply using registry:5000
1. check what images are in the local repo, if you do not see a list of images please run the commands in this section: [Get Images](#Get-images)
    ```bash
    $ curl localhost:5000/v2/_catalog -s | jq
    {
      "repositories": [
        "datawire/ambassador",
        "hello-app"
      ]
    }
    ```
1. Quick test (if this pod doesn't deploy, please have a look at the troubleshooting section)
    ```bash
    $ kubectl create deployment hello-server --image=registry:5000/hello-app:1.0
    $ kubectl get po -w
    NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    hello-server-7f9c5b8577-2n7x2   1/1     Running   0          10s
    ```
1. ingress test
    ``` bash
    $ kubectl run echo --image=registry:5000/inanimate/echo-server --port=8080
    $ kubectl expose deployment echo --type=LoadBalancer
    $ kubectl get service
    NAME                         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)                      AGE
    echo                         LoadBalancer   10.107.67.130    172.17.255.2   8080:32105/TCP               17m
    $ curl 172.17.255.2:8080
    ```
